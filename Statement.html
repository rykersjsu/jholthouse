    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
    <p>I think of my art as a critique of the queer culture that I was born into and the relationship of those people who surround it. Through the use of digital media, I have constructed and appropriated digital material in the form of photography, video, and sound to bring to life my concepts regarding the LGTBQ in all its aspects. My arrangements are very intentional, inviting the viewer to see my perspective.</p>
    <p>The work thus far has been carefully altered through computer software to emphasis process, point out stereotypes, respectfully explain, and shed light on the negative and positive aspects of this part of my life. There is much about my life that I can share, and I have found that communication through my artwork offers an interesting insight into this fringe community.
This project has always been grounded in pleasure and aesthetics.
