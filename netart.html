      <h3>The Queer Word, Netart, 2018</h3>
      <h3><a href="https://jholthouse.github.io/netart/" target="_blank">jholthouse.github.io/netart</a></h3>
      <p>For this piece I wanted to explore the idea of sharing information regarding queer culture. I have provided words from queer culture (plus their definitions), coming out stories, pictures of hate crimes, and significant people who have moved the queer community forward. I believe that information, communication, and sharing of feelings are the most important part of acceptance and this piece is the embodiment of that idea.</p>

      <h3>The Choices I've Faced, Netart, 2018</h3>
      <h3><a href="https://jholthouse.github.io/final_project/" target="_blank">jholthouse.github.io/final_project</a></h3>
      <p>Everyone faces different things in life. However, as different as they are there is always a common thread that each subculture has in common with each other. In the LGBTQ community, just like every other community, we share a common thread in that we all face some of the same situations. In this piece I am opening up a part of my life for inspection. The names and faces may be different, but the situations, feelings, and choices are very real. </p>
